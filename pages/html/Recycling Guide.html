           <b>Reduce and Reuse:</b>
            <br>• Make your devices last longer: Take care of your electronics with protective cases and regular cleaning. Update software and keep them running smoothly.
            <br>• Can it be repurposed? Could an old phone become an MP3 player? Can a tablet be used for e-reading? Get creative and extend the life of your gadgets!
            <br>• Donate to a good cause: Schools, libraries, and tech training programs can often use older electronics. Just be sure to wipe all personal data first!

        </p>
        <p class="right">
            Recycle Right:
            <br>• Find a certified e-waste recycler: Look online or ask at local electronics stores for drop-off locations. E-waste processors have the expertise to handle these materials safely and responsibly.
            <br>• Know what's accepted: Recycling programs may have specific guidelines about what they take. Be sure your e-waste is sorted correctly for the most effective processing.

            
        </p>
        <p class="leftdown">
            Modern Recycling Techniques:
            
            <br>• Urban mining: E-waste is a treasure trove of valuable materials like gold, copper, and rare earth elements. New techniques extract these materials for reuse in new products.
            <br>• Bio-shredding: Some companies are shredding e-waste with the help of microbes that can break down certain components, making it easier to recover valuable parts.

           </p> 
        <p class="final">
            Many more ways can be used according to the mass of e-waste being recycled. Lately these e-waste materials can be used to emake so many products and at a home basis you can make a so many products like a solar cellphone harger at a home basis and this also helps the environment due to a renewable source of energy and much more.
        Be keen of the warranty
        This is important because many products are made day in day out but not all manufacturers mind about their impact to the environment ,they are self minded actually they are money minded and so as consumers we need to show these manufacturers that Just make products that are last for a short time that we arent willing to buy them and also at some point they seem to be cheap but actually arent because we are forced to buy more and so spend more than if we had bought a long lasting product and also there is reduced e-waste and so protecting the environment. 
        The main principle behind modern recycling techniques is to reduce and reuse as much as possible before sending it into landfills or incineration. This means that you should always try to sort your equipment.
