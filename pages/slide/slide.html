                 E-waste is the fastest-growing waste stream on the planet
                 E-waste refers to discarded electrical or electronic devices. 
                 These devices contain a mix of valuable materials like gold, copper, and aluminium, alongside hazardous substances like lead, mercury, and flame retardants.

              <p class='description'>Improper e-waste disposal can have serious environmental consequences.Leaking toxins from landfills can contaminate soil and water, while burning e-waste releases harmful pollutants into the environment. Responsible e-waste management helps to:
                <br>•	Conserve natural resources by recovering valuable materials for reuse.
                <br>•	Reduce pollution by minimizing the need for raw material extraction and preventing toxic releases.
                <br>•	Protect human health by ensuring safe handling and disposal of hazardous materials.
